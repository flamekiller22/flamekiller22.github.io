# Imgur API

This project was made for the sole purpose of getting img tags that can be used in html to show the images pesent in an imgur album.

## How to use it
The link for an imgur album will be something like this: https://imgur.com/a/bg7wPeB or https://imgur.com/gallery/bg7wPeB
From this link copy the part that is after `imgur.com/a/` or `imgur.com/gallery/`, that is `bg7wPeB`. This is the **Album ID**.
