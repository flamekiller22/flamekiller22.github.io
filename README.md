# Imgur API

This project was made for the sole purpose of getting img tags that can be used in html to show the images pesent in an imgur album. If you wish to use this repo you will need an imgur account. Don't worry it's completely free.

## How to use it
The link for an imgur album will be something like this: https://imgur.com/a/bg7wPeB or https://imgur.com/gallery/bg7wPeB
From this link copy the part that is after `imgur.com/a/` or `imgur.com/gallery/`, that is `bg7wPeB`. This is the **Album ID**.

The next thing we need is the Client ID which is used as authentication for the Imgur API.
To get your client ID you can go to this [link](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient) and register your app there.
While registering your app you can choose any of the options provided, however if you are creating the app only to use it for this repo then I reccomend you go with this:

After this enter your email id and that's it.
